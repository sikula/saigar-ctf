### Major
- Only dmins can now assign judges to teams
    - In earlier releases, judges could automatically assign teams to themselves, and the flow of information being slightly out of sync. This ensures there is one source of truth about aiggned teams
- Removed incoming feed settings for Judges
    - No longer needed as the admins now assign judges to teams

### Minor
- Added timestamps to submissions in all views
    - Sometimes it is important to know when a submission was submitted (e.g. with hundreds of submissions coming in, some may have been left unprocessed for long periods of time)
    - Incoming feed now has timestamp of submission
    - History now has timestamp of submission on when it was processed
    - Submission info in contestant view now has timestamp for pending/approved/rejected submissions
- General UI/UX Improvements
    - Cleaning up the team filter flow for admins.
    - Team filter states are now persisted across page refreshes
    - History filter states now persist across refreshes
    
### Bug Fixes
- Fixed a bug where the team selection in the History tab for admins/contestants was not showing teams in alphabetical order
